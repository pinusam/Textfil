A typical paragraph has three parts: the topic sentence, the supporting sentence, and the concluding sentence. The topic sentence is usually the first sentence in a paragraph and it is then followed by the concluding sentences that usually comes in three sentences, and finally, the concluding sentence which is, obviously, found on the last part or after the supporting sentence. Writing concluding sentences can be optional because if you find that your entire paragraph can do without one, it is definitely all right to end your paragraph without a concluding statement.
